## ðŸ’» Instructions Backend

You will need in your machine **Node.js**,  **Yarn** and **Docker**. 

 - Run `yarn` to download all the dependencies needed to execute the project;

 - Lets install two images of two databases: Postgres, to storage our tables and Redis, a extremely perfomatic database that will send our emails with queues .
    ```bash
      # do a container with postgres image
      docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 -d postgres

      # do a container with redis image
      docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d -t redis:alpine
    ```
 - Run `yarn queue` to start the queue of the emails.

 - Run the `migrations` to create all the tables necessary for our application.
	  ```
   yarn sequelize db:migrate
   ```

 - Run the `seeds` to get the initial data of our application:
   ```
   yarn sequelize db:seed:all
   ```
   *Now you will have a  admin user with the email admin@fastfeet.com and password 123456 to do the auth login.*

  - In the root of the project, create a `.env` file and fill the informations according with the example `.env.example`;

 - After that, run `yarn dev` to start the backend.
